                        <p>Burlington's National Day of Civic Hacking attracted 50 civic hackers who worked on 10 different projects. Lakecraft, an educational tool that engages youth and adults in science by gamifying the Lake Champlain Basin, was started at the National Day of Civic Hacking. A team of volunteers working with the Vermont Digital Economy Project built WordPress websites for three Vermont non-profit organizations. An app for Green Up Vermont was built along with a Fish Stocking Schedule app. An instance of MediaWiki was installed for a Burlington City Wiki. A "School Juice" team brainstormed ways to begin providing electricity usage data from Burlington's new smart meters in some useful and open ways to the public. A Discourse discussion forum was installed and work was started on a Music Venue Directory for Big Heavy World, a non-profit organization that promotes and preserves Vermont-made music.</p>

                        <p>Hack the Stacks was a civic hacking event held in collaboration with Fletcher Free Library. About 30 civic hackers participated in this event. Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger opened the hackathon. Over the weekend, a "green" printing app was created to reduce unintentional and wasteful printing in Fletcher Free Library's public access computer center. A team of volunteers continued to work with the Vermont Digital Economy Project to create and update websites for Vermont non-profit organizations. The Lakecraft team used the hackathon as an opportunity to continue to work on the project and to attempt to recruit new members to the team.</p>

These websites are helping to make Vermont non-profits more connected, and thus are making Vermont communities more resilient.</p>

                    <p>BTV Ignite is a partnership between US Ignite and the City of Burlington that is leveraging Burlington's gigabit network as a test bed for the development of next generation gigabit Internet applications. Brigade Captains Jason Pelletier and Bradley Holt published a report in March of 2013 called "Burlington's Gigabit Opportunity" as part of an initiative called BTV Gig. With a foreword by Blair Levin, author of the National Broadband Plan, the report describes a strategy for developing a thriving culture of innovation around gigabit across a diverse range of constituents within Burlington. Brigade Captain Bradley Holt serves on the Burlington Mayor's BTV Ignite Advisory Committee. Code for BTV works with BTV Ignite and Burlington Telecom to make high-speed connectivity available at hackathons whenever possible.</p>

                    <p>The Civic Cloud Collaborative includes eight forward-thinking organizations working to create civic and public spaces within Burlington's gigabit network. The Civic Cloud will provide tools for innovative community organizers, non-profits and civic hackers in Burlington, Vermont. The Civic Cloud will build on Burlington's fiber-optic gigabit network which provides Internet speeds of over 100 times the average national broadband speed. The Civic Cloud will be available for the community to use as a platform for public, non-commercial Internet applications and digital creative works.</p>
                    <p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation has awarded a $35,000 Knight Prototype Fund grant to the Civic Cloud Collaborative. This grant will be used to construct a prototype of the Civic Cloud. Knight experiments with digital technology, online community and new grant-making concepts to connect with innovators worldwide.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Today's announcement is further evidence of Burlington's growing reputation as a green, tech City able to leverage tremendous community resources through partnerships like BTV Ignite to catalyze economic development that benefits our City. The Civic Cloud will help make our impressive network available for greater public use. I am grateful for Knight Foundation's grant, and optimistic about the potential that resides here in Burlington."</p>

                    <p><a href="http://newmoran.org/">New Moran</a> is a plan to redevelop the landmark Moran Generating Station on Burlington's waterfront into a mixed-use, energy self-sufficient civic space. New Moran will be a hub for community gatherings while supporting human-powered recreation and access to local food, art, energy, and technology. Code for BTV is a New Moran program partner and plans to use New Moran as a community research &amp; development hub, an educational space, and a space for gathering and collaboration.</p>

                <p>Many people from the Burlington community contributed to the launch and ongoing success of Code for BTV. Several people stepped up to help organize both the National Day of Civic Hacking and Hack the Stacks. In September of 2013, Bradley Holt and Jason Pelletier joined the Code for America Brigade Captains program. They attended the Code for America Summit and Brigade Captains' training in October of 2013.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"As Burlington's reputation as a green, tech City continues to grow, I am impressed but not surprised that Code for BTV has been selected to join the ranks of the national Code for America Brigade. I offer many thanks to Bradley Holt and Jason Pelletier for launching Code for BTV and congratulate them on the well-deserved recognition of being named Brigade Captains."</p>

                <p>Code for BTV has published a 2014 strategy document. Code for BTV will continue to leverage social production as a means to facilitate a more participatory democracy at the local level. Civic hacking is a participatory effort to improve communities through technology. Inclusivity will continue to be a critical organizing tool employed by Code for BTV. Code for BTV will work to deepen existing collaborations and pursue new opportunities to collaborate with organizations and individuals.</p>
                <p>Code for BTV plans to hold at least four major hackathons and nine monthly meetups in 2014. Code for BTV will start holding weekly <a href="http://codeforbtv.org/office-hours/">Office Hours at Burlington City Hall</a> during which elected officials, government staff, individuals, and civic hackers can participate in free and open dialogue about our community's challenges and opportunities. Code for BTV will also start hosting monthly hack nights as an alternative to weekend events.</p>
